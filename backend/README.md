الحمد لله اخيرا قدرت اشوفها دلوقت:
تمام اوي كدا بس فيه بعض التعديلات:
1. in port section you forgot to add SOCKS and you just added http
2. remove the country or comment its code for now, cuz the client said am just targeting Netherlands
3. in UserName:Password you got the wrong name:password instead it should be: *abdullah:server1* , *nokta:proxy* and so on instead of these amount of string
4. are the ended time are hard code? I already include its data
5. what is the ping states? could you please tell me cuz I can't remember
6. the buttons are not working... and I already provided all of their functionality or you didn't worked on it yet.. -> also the download proxy button I end it in the backend and gonna deploy the route for it
7. could you please add: 'CELLOP' from the data which is 'Vodafone L, and Odido' and others...
