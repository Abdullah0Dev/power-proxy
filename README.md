! Main Overview:
So the main project/goal is to have a website for the sale [frontend] and managing of mobile proxies [back end]

I currently have a service where i rent out mobile 4G proxies. Now all sales are manual trough telegram from setup/payment/renewal/request for changes.

The software that i use to make and manage the proxies is called proxysmart https://proxysmart.org/. On the backend we will need to implement a dashboard that can controle the mobile proxies for clients.
The proxies have a dashboard currently which i can use to control the proxies. But the client do it. The goal is to connect this dashboard with the backend for each client, for the proxies they have rented.

Documentation about this can be found on their website https://proxysmart.org/wiki/v2:readme
